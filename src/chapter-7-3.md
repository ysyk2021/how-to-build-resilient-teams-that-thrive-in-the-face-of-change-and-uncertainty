By collecting data, leaders can gain insights into the effectiveness of their team resilience strategies and make informed decisions about how to improve them.

Soliciting Feedback

By soliciting feedback from team members, leaders can gain valuable insights into what's working well and what could be improved about their team resilience strategies.

Adjusting Strategies as Needed
