As a leader, modeling resilient behaviors is crucial for promoting team resilience. Leaders should prioritize:

* Encouraging team members to embrace challenges and take calculated risks.

By modeling resilient behaviors, leaders can inspire their teams to be more adaptive and innovative in the face of change and uncertainty.

In addition to modeling resilient behaviors, leaders should also provide support and resources to help their teams build their own resilience. Leaders should prioritize:

* Offering training and development opportunities to help team members build new skills and adapt to changing circumstances
* Providing mental health resources such as counseling services and stress management techniques
* Ensuring that team members have the tools and resources they need to do their jobs effectively.
