To implement team resilience strategies effectively, organizations should:

* Prioritize ongoing training and development programs that focus on key characteristics of resilient teams, such as effective communication, collaboration, problem-solving skills, a growth mindset, and stress management.

Overcoming barriers to effective implementation is critical for building resilient teams. Some common barriers include:
