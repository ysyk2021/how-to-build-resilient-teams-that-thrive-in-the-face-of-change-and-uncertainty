Offer training, resources, and workshops that help individuals enhance their ability to cope with stress, adapt to change, and bounce back from setbacks. By building individual resilience, the team as a whole becomes more resilient.

**7. Embrace Change Management Strategies**

Utilize change management strategies to navigate through major transitions. Implement processes and frameworks that facilitate smooth adaptation, such as creating change management teams, conducting impact assessments, and providing support during the transition period. Proactively manage change to minimize disruption and foster team resilience.

**8. Promote Learning and Continuous Improvement**

Engage with leadership and stakeholders to seek support during times of change and uncertainty. Keep them informed of the team's progress, challenges, and needs. Collaboration with leadership and stakeholders can provide valuable insights, resources, and guidance to navigate through turbulent times effectively.
